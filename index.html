                <p>The next part of planning is to determine your starting and ending parts. This could be a place close
                    to home and sail in one area or start and finish at two different parts. Generally, starting and stopping
                    in the same part will save you money and is usally more convenient. You can als fly to a dstination far from home, and then sail another exotic sea. There are luxury yacht
                    charter companies that cruise the Caribbean and Meditererranean seas or around Alaska, the Panama Cabnal, or any place you can imagine.
                </p>
                <p>Determining the type of cruise is another aspect of planning a chartered yatching trip. You can have as little or many crew members as the ship will hold. A 
                    captain takes all the worries out of navigating and onboard houskeeping services make it a real vacation that rivals the finest hotel services. 
                    You can also choose to have a chef and service crew as part of your vacation package.

                    if you like the idea of knowing what is is really like to sail, but don't want to risk safety, you can charter a sailing cruise that puts
                    you in the role of deck hand. A competent crew will detect you as to your "chores" for keeping the ship in the top shape and on course.

                    Destinations & Ports of important Charte Companies One of the greatest benefits of choosing a chartered cruise as a vacation is the choice.
                    You will most likely have a rough itinerary and that can be affected by the weather. However, you are flexible in deciding how long you want to stay in a particular Port
                    and if you want to add or subtract stops along the way.
